"""Prove the pull-request lane half of CV-005: it ratchets like main.

Each test mutates a copy of the workflows in the way a later edit could and
asserts that the clause meant to catch that edit does: the lane's coverage
step ratchets against main's baseline at the publisher's pin and selection,
and its contract step runs unconditionally.
